                    <strong>BISV Hacks</strong> is an inclusive, student-led hackathon organized by the Programming for 
                    Data Science & Machine Learning Club at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. The hackathon 
                        will run throughout the day, hosting over many participants from many different 
                        areas.

                <p>
                    Our event is designed to encourage creativity and collaboration by bringing together students of all experience 
                    levels. Participants will either form teams or work solo to develop innovative projects, solve real-world 
                    challenges, and gain valuable experience to fix these issues. In addition to coding, attendees will have the 
                    opportunity to hear and gain advice from inspiring speakers, who are industry professionals, and engage in hands-on 
                    workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A highlight of BISV Hacks is our focus on inclusivity and accessibility. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or 
                    completely new to coding, we welcome you to join us. We also provide lunch, snacks, and refreshments to fuel your 
                    creativity throughout the day.
